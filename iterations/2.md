# First Feature

You must update the project board throughout the course to keep track of your progress.

To begin working on a feature, convert the corresponding note into a [GitHub Issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues), assign the issue to the group members who are responsible for the feature, and break it apart in smaller tasks.

You may move notes around when the plan changes. When you’re done working on the feature, create a [GitHub Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) associated with the issue, merge it, and close the issue.

Criteria for completion:

- Tests
- Documentation
  - API design
- Deploy
